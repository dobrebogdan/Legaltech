If the donated goods have been replaced with others, the value, at the date of opening the inheritance, of the goods entered in the patrimony and their condition at the time of acquisition are taken into account. However, if the devaluation of the assets entered in the patrimony was inevitable at the date of acquisition, by virtue of their nature, the replacement of the assets is not taken into account. To the extent that the donated property or the one that replaced it perished accidentally, regardless of the date of death, the donation will not be subject to fictitious reunion. The sums of money are subject to indexation in relation to the inflation index, corresponding to the period between the date of their entry in the patrimony of the donee and the date of opening the inheritance.
(3) Ordinary donations, remunerative donations and, insofar as they are not excessive, the amounts spent on the maintenance or, where appropriate, vocational training of the descendants, parents or children shall not be taken into account. nor the wedding expenses.

In the latter case, only the part in excess of the global reserve is charged against the available quota. In all cases, if the available quota is exceeded, the liberality is subject to reduction.
